Splitr
======

Splitr is a Split Timer Application for Speedrunning.
The application is made natively for OSX that will hopefully serve as the main Split Timer in the Mac/OSX Speedrun community.

This project was started in December 2014 and is still in it's very early design stages.
This Repo will hold all updates to the program.
